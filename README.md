# RelativisticIllumination
Calculations around relativistic illumination effects

These calculations are inspired by the following book:
- [Faster than Light: How Your Shadow Can Do It but You Can't](https://www.amazon.com/Faster-than-Light-Your-Shadow/dp/1662933843)
- Author: [Robert J. Nemiroff](https://www.mtu.edu/physics/department/faculty/nemiroff/)

The calculations are done in Jupyter notebooks with Python programming.

## Jupyter notebook *MoonSweep*
This notebook does analytical calculations for the following scenario:
- An observer on Earth sweeps a laser pointer with constant angular speed across the surface of the Moon, along a straight path through the center of the observed Moon disk.
- Calculate the time when the laser ray arrives at each point of the path that is traced by the beam on the Moon's surface.
- Plot the data.
This visualizes the relativistic image doubling that happens for the cases an arrival time is realized by two scenarios (early departure but longer path vs later departure but shorter path). Nemiroff's book explains this in detail.
